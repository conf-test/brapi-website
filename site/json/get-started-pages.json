But with its 179 possible endpoints and 36+ different data models, it can seem overwhelming for new developers to get started. So we have created this \"Getting Started\" tutorial page to help get new community members up to speed. If you are new to BrAPI, this is the place to start!</p> <p>BrAPI is a RESTful API specificaiton, so before reading this documentation, it will be helpful to understand a little bit about REST and how it works. There are many online resources available for learning about REST. A good starting place is <a href=\"https://www.restapitutorial.com/\" target=\"_blank\">RestApiTutorial.com</a> to understand the basics and some of the current best practices. </p> <p>If you have any specific questions about BrAPI which are not answered here, please reach out to a <a href=\"mailto:brapicoordinatorselby@gmail.com\">project coordinator</a> or join the community Slack channel. </p>"
