        "article": "<h3>Hola from Texcoco,</h3>  <p>September 14 concluded another successful BrAPI Hackathon. A big THANK YOU to Sandra Montanez and everyone at CIMMYT who made this event possible. Sandra did a fantastic job making sure we were well fed, well rested, and had everything we needed. During the months of planning before the hackathon, she made my life immeasurably easier, by helping to organize travel for everyone and navigate VISA requirements. </p>  <p>Here are a few highlights from the hackathon, though it is tough to convey several days of discussion in a couple of sentences. Please reach out to me with any questions you have with any of these topics.</p>  <h4>BrAPI 101</h4>  <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">We held a “BrAPI 101” class for newcomers to the community. Eight BrAPI newbies joined me on Monday morning for a few hours to learn what BrAPI is and how to use it. We discussed the basics of RESTful APIs, how to construct BrAPI calls, and the different tools and resources available to members of the BrAPI Community. Then everyone took a little time to implement a simple BrAPI client in their favorite programming language. By Monday afternoon, we had eight new BrAPI experts in the community. </p>  <h4>Phenotypic Data Model</h4>  <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">I originally added “Phenotypic Data Model” as an optional discussion topic and I had no specific plan for what we were going to discuss. However, the community quickly spoke up, and we had a very productive discussion about improving the data models for Studies, Observation Units, and Observations. The biggest revelation from the discussion was recognizing the need to nest Observation Units within each other.  For example, an Observation Unit that represents a plant should be able to reference an Observation Unit that represents the plot that contains the plant. </p>  <h4>Analysis Data</h4>  <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">There has been some interest in the handling Analysis Data. This data is created after performing some computational analysis on raw, field collected, data. During the hackathon, we quickly realized that we have to be very careful about how detailed we need to be in BrAPI. The group was stuck a few times debating how much information about the analysis methods needs to be communicated. Is the primary use case simply to store results, or is there a need to communicate enough information for analysis replication? We did not come to any satisfying conclusion, but it was a good discussion and got everyone thinking.</p>  <h4>Genotypic Data Model</h4>  <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">We had a very productive discussion focused on the Genomic Maps, Markers, Marker Profiles, and Allele Matrices calls. We started with some clarifications around what data lives in a Marker object versus a Map object and how the two are related. Then, we approached the ugly thorn of the group: Marker Profiles. Lukas gave us a recap on the definition of a Marker Profile, and then we got into a slightly heated discussion on changing the name “Marker Profile” and changing the returned object structure. No decisions have been made yet, and I am planning to organize some follow up discussions soon.</p>  <h4>Sample Submission Project</h4>  <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">There was a large group working on the Sample Submission Project. This is an EiB effort to allow submission of sample data to a genotyping vendor, then storing the resulting data into a genotypic database, through automated APIs instead of emailing excel spreadsheets. During the hackathon, some significant development progress was made. The BMS developers worked with the GOBii developers to start sending sample data to the GOBii database, and the CIMMYT Sample Tracking developers worked with the DArT and Cornell GBS developers to start submitting samples for genotyping. I am very happy with the progress and I look forward to working with all these groups in the coming months.</p>  <h4>Libraries</h4>  <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">Both the BrAPI R library and the BrAPI.js library had significant work put into them during this hackathon. They are both updated to fully support BrAPI v1.2, and work was begun towards automating some of the update process based on the Swagger definition files. This should decrease the maintenance time in the future.</p>  <h4>HTML Flapjack BrAPP</h4>  <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">The JHI developers successfully hacked together a first version of an HTML based Flapjack BrAPP. This is a simplified version of the desktop Flapjack visualization tool that can be hosted by any (BrAPI compliant) web server. HTML Flapjack is not meant to replace its desktop counterpart, but rather supplement it, by allowing users to see a preview of their data, before downloading a full Flapjack project to run analysis on. </p>  "

        "article":"<h3>V1.3 Release Date </h3>  <p>Announcement: The BrAPI v1.3 release date has been moved to October 26. This represents a shift from a 3-month release cycle to a 6-month release cycle. After versions 1.1 and 1.2, it was clear that the 3-month cycle was too quick for many in the community. I hope everyone is comfortable with this shift, please let me know if you have any concerns. </p>  <h3>App Development </h3>  <p>We recently wrapped up the PhenoApps Hackathon here at Cornell, organized by the KSU FieldBook team. There was a lot of great work on mobile app projects, and some significant focus on applying BrAPI for mobile app data communication. We took steps toward using existing BrAPI calls to push data back and forth between FieldBook and a centralized database. There was some work into developing a set of BrAPI calls around image storage and retrieval, and some work developing a BrAPI Android library, based on the Swagger Code Gen tool. It was a very productive event and a good way to test out a few more concrete BrAPI use cases. If you are interested in the outcomes of any of these projects, let me know and I can put you in touch with the team who worked on them. </p>  <h3>Sample Submission Project </h3>  <p>In the beginning of July, I began working on a substantial system integration project within the Excellence in Breeding platform. The goal is to automate the submission of sample data to an external processing vendor and collect the resulting lab output to a data repository. I will be working with a group of developers from several different teams over the coming month to implement this automated process. This will be one of the first official integration projects within the EiB and BrAPI is playing a central role. I will soon post documentation related to this use case on the BrAPI Wiki so that other groups in the BrAPI community may follow a similar pattern of calls. </p>  <h3>Texcoco Hackathon </h3>  <p>As we get closer to September, I have been looking at the popular projects and discussion topics, based on the short survey on the hackathon sign up form. Right now, the top 3 discussion topics will be around improving the phenotypic data model, web service authentication, and adding calls for handling generic analysis data. There is also significant interest in a \"BrAPI for Beginners\" class which I will run on the first day to welcome all of the people who are new to the community. For project work, I anticipate a big push for mobile phenotype data collection and the sample submission projects I've already mentioned, plus a continued interest in BrAPPs. </p>  <p>OBLIGATORY REMINDER: Sign up <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXFyoyT3VLovNJ9x9OGMjEm95KhjLTyBIQmGWYlBrRv0Eg1Q/viewform\">HERE</a> for the next BrAPI Hackathon!</p>  <h3>The BrAPI Paper </h3>  <p>Lukas, Jan Erik and I have begun the submission process for the BrAPI Paper. I will announce when it has been accepted and published. Thank You so much to everyone who has contributed! This truly was a community effort!</p>"

Click <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXFyoyT3VLovNJ9x9OGMjEm95KhjLTyBIQmGWYlBrRv0Eg1Q/viewform\">HERE</a> or go to the <a href=\"/events.php\">Events page</a> on brapi.org to reserve your seat today!!</p>  <p><p>I encourage everyone to fill out the form and reserve a spot, even if you are not sure you can attend. I know that traveling in the second half of the year can be challenging as budgets get tighter, but I'm hopeful that the organizations you represent see the added value of spending a week learning from and working with your peers from around the world. </p>  <p>The Sign Up form also includes a small survey about what BrAPI related discussions and projects would be most useful to you. We will be building an agenda based on your feedback, so please give it some thought. What aspects of BrAPI need to be discussed by the community? Which other teams would you like to integrate with? What BrAPI related projects has your team been neglecting? </p>  <br/>  <h3>The BrAPI Paper</h3>  <p>Thank you to everyone who took the time to add comments and contributions to the BrAPI Paper. We received so many excellent edits and responses that we have decided to do a second round of community feedback! Lukas, Jan Erik, and I are working hard to incorporate everyone's feedback into the draft document, once we are complete, we will open the google doc for comments again. If you missed the first round, or you weren't able to review the whole document, now is your chance to have your voice heard. I will send out a separate announcement when we are ready.</p>  <br/>  <h3>Swagger</h3>  <p>I'm pleased to announce that BrAPI is now defined using the OpenAPI standard, better known as Swagger. All the old Markdown files have been replaced by YAML files in the master GitHub branch and these YAML files will be the source of all BrAPI documentation starting in V1.3. In an effort to make this transition as smooth as possible, I have included a README file with each group of calls which documents each call in the old Blueprint format. These README's are generated from the source YAML files, so they will not need to be manually maintained. Also, for those of you who have gotten used to Apiary, the Apiary site supports displaying the OpenAPI format. The display looks a little different, but I'm working on making it as user friendly as Apiary will allow. And finally, for those of you who are fans and supporters of Swagger, BrAPI is now officially on SwaggerHub and is ready for all the fancy tools available in the Swagger ecosystem. I'd like to thank Ricardo Ramírez-Gonzalez and Arlo Hoogeveen for their help in this Swagger transformation during the Versailles hackathon.</p>  <p>If you have any questions about Swagger or how to use this new incarnation of BrAPI, feel free to reach out to me.</p>"

Keep watch on <a href=\"https://brapi.org/events.php\">Brapi.org</a> for more details, or check the <a href=\"https://forum.brapi.org/t/brapi-hacakthon-texcoco-fall-2018/51/2\">Community Forum</a> and share your excitement. A signup form will be coming soon! </p><p>I'm really excited about the upcoming hackathon. We are prepared for a larger turnout this time, so hopefully we won't have to turn anyone away. Still, the earlier you can sign up, the better, because seats tend to go fast. We received a lot of feedback from Versailles that some kind of introduction to BrAPI for new-comers would be helpful. In response, I have already set aside two and a half hours on day one for this purpose. If you know any individuals or groups who would benefit from BrAPI, encourage them to sign up for this hackathon.</p><p>In other news, BrAPI V1.2 is scheduled to be released next week (April 27th). This release will contain 24 issue fixes, from old clean up items, to newer things discussed in Versailles. This release has been the topic of lots of discussion in the past 6 months, not because of its contents, but because of its timing. This is the test of a 3 month release cycle, and I will be eager to here feedback from the community around this. If no one in the community has the time or resources to implement V1.2, then I will happily drop the 3 month release cycle in favor of a 6 month release cycle. Let me know your thoughts around this, either by email or the <a href=\"https://forum.brapi.org/\">Community Forum.</a></p><p>In parallel with the work on V1.2, a lot of work has been put into a BrAPI Swagger definition. The intent is to change the specification from the \"Blueprint\" markdown format to the \"OpenAPI\" YAML format (aka \"Swagger\"). The OpenAPI format has a strict structure and is a little harder for humans to read, but it will enable lots of cool automated tasks. This includes documentation presentation in a number of different platforms and automatic code generation in 20+ coding languages. Look for that update on GItHub in the next few weeks.</p><p>Finally, we are working on an official BrAPI Publication. Jan Erik, Lukas and I have been working on a draft of this paper and it is almost ready for community input. BrAPI is a community project and we must have the contribution of that community in this publication, so please don't be shy! Even if you have no explicit text to add, leave a comment letting us know that you read it and approve. I'll be sending out details on how to access the draft in the next few weeks.</p>"

My hope is that it can replace the Documentation Github repository as the source for all BrAPI related documentation. All the old documents from Github have already been transferred to the new site, and a few new things have already been added.

Look for this to go live in the next few weeks at <a href=\"https://forum.brapi.org\">https://forum.brapi.org</a><p>In other news, the EiB Annual Planning meeting concluded a couple weeks ago in Nairobi, Kenya. There were many productive discussions across all 5 EiB modules. The Module #5 group had good representation of many of the major technologies used by the CGIAR, including BrAPI. We focused on what an ideal IT architecture for a breeding program should look like so we could determine what tools and services are missing, and where the important integration points are between tools. The development teams present agreed on 2 critical BrAPI related integration use cases for 2018: Phenotype field data collection, and Genotype sample data collection.</p><p>Also, at the EiB meeting, we were able to discuss scheduling of upcoming events in 2018, which includes the next BrAPI Hackathon. Based on that discussion, we are targeting September for the next hackathon, though exact dates and venue are still undecided. I will let everyone know as soon as I know more.</p>"

        "date": "February 14, 2018",
        "author": "Peter Selby",
        "article": "<h3>Greetings from Versailles,</h3><p>Last Friday concluded another successful BrAPI Hackathon. I wanted to take a moment to record some of the highlights of the event and open the discussion to those who were not able to attend. </p><p>First, a very very big “THANK YOU” to Cyril Pommier and everyone at INRA who helped make this event possible. Organizing an event like this takes months of planning and coordination. Cyril was instrumental in getting the venue setup and ready for as many people as we could hold. And then, for those not following the weather reports in Versailles, we were welcomed by a surprise snow storm on Tuesday, which made transportation difficult for everyone. The INRA staff valiantly fought through the snow and we were still able to eat and access our equipment. </p><h3 style=\"margin-top: 50px;\">Discussions Highlights</h3><p>Here are a few discussion highlights and big plans made during the hackathon. Nothing here is set in stone, and it is tough to convey several hours of discussion in a couple of sentences. Please reach out to me with any questions or concerns you have with any of these topics.</p><h4>JSON-LD/PUIDs</h4><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">There is a new tentative plan around JSON-LD and entity Permanent Unique IDs. It was established that there are 2 problems which need solving. First, is the problem of “sameness”: being able to determine if two entities from two different systems refer to the same thing. Second, is the problem of “origin” or “authority”: what created a particular entity and who has the authority to enforce the data is correct for that entity. <br/> The solution plan has 3 phases, which will be included in future BrAPI versions. First, add a PUID field to each BrAPI entity to check for “sameness”. Second, an “origin” object will be added to each BrAPI entity with enough information to lead a user back to the origin of that object. These two new fields should be enough to solve the problems stated, but from here it is a short leap to implement JSON-LD. So the final phase is some implementation of JSON-LD, which will allow for a whole host of new functionality. </p><h4>Authentication</h4><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">Authentication is a feared subject for many in the BrAPI community and it is a complex problem which will hang around for a long time. During the discussion at the hackathon, we started with the basics of how OAuth2 works, the different options available and then moved into how do we create a general solution in the context of BrAPI. It was generally agreed that it is not within the API’s power to enforce any sort of authentication scheme, but the best we could do was establish a clear set of Best Practices. That list is under development and should be available with BrAPI V1.2.</p><h4>New Calls</h4><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">There were several discussions around new BrAPI calls which were needed for a variety of use cases. These included User Created Lists, Seed/Planting Material Tracking, and Germplasm Advanced Search. Each of these discussion outlined a new set of objects and issues were created in the BrAPI GitHub to track their addition to the spec. </p><h3 style=\"margin-top: 50px;\">Project Highlights </h3><p>There was a lot of work accomplished during this hackathon and too many projects to list everything here. Below is an overview of the projects which have the greatest impact on the whole BrAPI community.</p><h4>BrAPI R</h4><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">A small team worked on cleaning up the BrAPI R library and moved it all to a new home under the CIP Github organization. Links to the new repository have been update on brapi.org. The team also started two new R packages: BrAPI X and BrAPI UI. BrAPI X provides eXtra tools for convenient bulk download breeding data and also do quick summaries and quality checks. BrAPI UI integrates with RStudio to provide interactive visualization tools which work with the BrAPI R library. </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><a class=\"btn btn-d btn-round\" style=\"margin-left:10px\" href=\"https://github.com/CIP-RIU/brapi\">BrAPI R</a><a class=\"btn btn-d btn-round\" style=\"margin-left:10px\" href=\"https://github.com/c5sire/brapix\">BrAPI X</a><a class=\"btn btn-d btn-round\" style=\"margin-left:10px\" href=\"https://github.com/c5sire/brapiui\">BrAPI UI</a></p><h4>BrAPI.js</h4><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">BrAPI.js is a JavaScript client library for BrAPI. It provides a simple, fluid interface for making BrAPI calls and functionality for chaining groups of calls together and returning a larger complete dataset. Though some of the more complex data manipulation tools are still in development, the core BrAPI interface is ready and can shorten the development time for anyone implementing a BrAPI client in JavaScript. </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><a class=\"btn btn-d btn-round\" style=\"margin-left:10px\" href=\"https://github.com/solgenomics/BrAPI.js\">BrAPI.js</a></p><h4>Testing Resources</h4><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">BrAVA (the BrAPI Validator App) has been updated. It now runs a full suite of validation tests against any BrAPI compliant server, checking for the correct JSON schema. It also runs these tests regularly against any server endpoint located in the brapi-resources.xml. This provides a nice checkup for all the existing public BrAPI servers. Now is a great time for everyone to make sure their published server endpoints and ‘calls’ call are up to date.<br/>The BrAPI official test server is now live. This is a Java Spring server backed by a generic Postgres database based only on BrAPI objects.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><a class=\"btn btn-d btn-round\" style=\"margin-left:10px\" href=\"http://webapps.ipk-gatersleben.de/brapivalidator/\">BrAVA</a><a class=\"btn btn-d btn-round\" style=\"margin-left:10px\" href=\"https://test-server.brapi.org/brapi/v1/\">Test Server</a></p><h4>BrAPP implementations</h4><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">Several teams used the Hackathon as an opportunity to add some BrAPPs to their existing applications. This is very exciting and very cool to see this type of tool sharing across the community. There was also a lot of great feedback going back to the BrAPP creators for bug fixes and possible enhancements. Watch for more BrAPPs coming this year.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><a class=\"btn btn-d btn-round\" style=\"margin-left:10px\" href=\"https://test.brapi.org/brapps.php\">BrAPPs</a></p><h4>Integration Implementations</h4><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">A substantial amount of time was dedicated to implementing some prototypes for broad system integration. The primary focus was on a pedigree verification use case established in December. The group was able to connect data in GOBii to data in BMS or B4R and produce an object which Flapjack was able to read and turn into a visualization. There is still a lot of work need before something like this is production ready, but this was a great first step to realizing this kind of cross system integration with BrAPI.</p>"

        "author": "Peter Selby",
        "article": "<p>Brapi.org has been updated!</p> <p>The original site was developed in an afternoon during the 2017 Seattle hackathon. It was an excellent start, and gave the BrAPI community a public face and brand. But it was not very developer friendly. As a single page site, every addition quickly created a monolithic structure. It was becoming a hassle to update and was starting to become difficult for users to find relevant information.</p> <h4>Whats new?</h4> <p>The majority of the changes can be seen in the server side file structure. Feel free to take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/plantbreeding/brapi-website\">BrAPI site GitHub</a> for more details. Generally speaking, the single giant html file has changed into a handful of smaller PHP files, which are much easier to develop and manage. Also,the whole project has been Dockerized, which makes server management and deployments of future updates much easier.</p> <p>From a user perspective, there has been some reorganization to promote usability. The single home page has been broken into a small set of logical pages. The \"About\" and \"Use Cases\" sections have been lumped together and are still on the home page. The \"Links\" section has become \"Developer Resources\" and now lives on its own page. The \"Partners\" and \"Acknowledgements\" sections have been lumped together and now have their own page as well. And finally,two new pages have been added: \"News\" and \"Events\". \"News\" is intended to be a general purpose, public place to post about BrAPI, the community, and related content (for example, this post you are reading). \"Events\" is for BrAPI related event notices, primarily Hackathons right now, but could grow in the future.</p> <p>Brapi.org is a great place for outside groups to discover and learn about the BrAPI community.
